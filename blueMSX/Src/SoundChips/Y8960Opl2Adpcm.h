/*****************************************************************************
**
** Forked for the Y8960 cartridge, 2026 by madscient.
**
** The cartridge's OPL2EX is a YM3812 with ADPCM-B bolted on, and its register
** map is the Y8950's, so this is the Y8950 port with three changes: the four
** waveforms a YM3812 has and a Y8950 does not, the MSX-AUDIO parts the
** cartridge does not carry (keyboard connector, 13 bit DAC, periphery), and a
** sample RAM that lives outside the circuit so that two circuits can share it.
**
** It is a fork rather than an extension because the machine's own MSX-AUDIO
** keeps using the unmodified port; both end up in one binary. The namespace
** is what keeps them apart.
