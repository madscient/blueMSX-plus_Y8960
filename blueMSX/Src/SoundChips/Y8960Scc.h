** Forked for the Y8960 cartridge, 2026 by madscient.
** The cartridge carries an SCC-equivalent circuit (IKASCC in the hardware),
** not a Konami SCC, so it is emulated as its own chip rather than sharing
** the machine's. Divergence in behaviour is expected as the hardware is
** finished; keeping them separate is what makes that possible.
